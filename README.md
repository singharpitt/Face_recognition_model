# Face Recognition Model

This project demonstrates basic face recognition using real-time data to provide accurate outputs.

## Overview

The Face Recognition Model utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize faces in real-time video streams or images. The model processes the input data, detects faces, and matches them against a database or predefined list of known faces. It then provides an output indicating whether a recognized face matches any known individuals.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Matching detected faces against a database or known faces.
- Providing output with identification results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.

- **Face Recognition**: Python library for face recognition tasks.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-model.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   cd face-recognition-model
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Ensure your camera is connected or provide a video stream as input.
- The application will detect faces in real-time and attempt to recognize them based on pre-trained models or known face data.
